  "The trail to Archangel Falls is a non-technical hike, but it is long (9 miles round trip) and stressful. The hike crosses a creek multiple times and climbs over and around MANY large rocks and boulders. The worst part(s) of the hike are toward the beginning (and the end): as you hike down (and then up on the return) a 500ft. vertical trek with many steep and rocky switchbacks to the creek below. The total roundtrip will take 6-9 hours, so I would suggest starting the hike as close to first light as possible.\n" +

//White Pocket
export const whitePocket =
  "I would rate the difficulty of this trail as a 5 on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being most difficult). The drive to the White Pocket is 36 miles and takes about 2 1/2 hours to get there (from US89). The majority of the long drive is on ranch-style dirt roads. However, the last 5 miles are made up of DEEP SAND and rock sections. A 4x4 vehicle with good ground clearance and good off-road tires are a must. If you get stuck, it is very difficult to dig yourself out and the cost for extraction can run upward of $1,000. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "Even if you have a high clearance, 4-wheel drive vehicle – I would strongly suggest letting air out of your tires down to 10 -15 lbs of pressure which allows your tires to expand and gives them more traction in deep sand. For this reason, you will need a portable air compressor for the ride home.\n" +

  "TAKE THE DRIVE SERIOUS! If you are driving a street version (rental) SUV with 2-wheel drive and think you can make it to the White Pocket – think again, because you stand a strong chance of getting stuck!

In this summary, we provide 3 different locations: 1) The classic location popularized by Galen Rowell, 2) an alternate location (southside) between the Cathedral Beach picnic area and the Swinging Bridge along the banks of the Merced River and 3) a viewpoint along the Four Mile trail. The first two locations are easy (right off the road) and the last location is about 3/4 of a mile up the Four Mile trail which may be snow covered and might require micro-spikes or sturdy hiking boots.  \n" +
  "\n" +
  "The challenge with these locations is that they are relatively small areas and the popularity of the event results in hundreds of people, cameras and tripods jammed together. Photographers often begin staking their claim to a tripod location shortly after sunrise, setup a camp chair and just spend the day enjoying the outdoors and communing with other photographers. The challenge is finding views of the falls that are clear of the numerous tall trees that often block the line of site. As such, there are only a handful of places that offer a clear viewpoint. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "Compounding these challenges are the recent efforts by the NPS to control the crowds and mitigate some of the damage that has been occurring to the meadows. These efforts include closing the Northside Drive to cars, implementing a lottery system for parking, and severely restricting where people can go to view the falls. This is a work-in-progress for the NPS, so you’ll need to check the Yosemite website under the Plan Your Visit > Places to Go > Waterfalls section for the most current information. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "Assuming the roads have not been closed to parking, there are minimal parking areas on both North and South side drives. Unless you arrive very early in the morning to stake your claim, be prepared to park in one of the lots near the visitor center or the lodge and either walk or take the shuttle bus.";

However, there is a steep drop from the edge, and it could get wet from the water splash (during high flow season).

The place where you are standing for this shot is a mound 10 ft or so above the ground and you could fall, but with careful foot placement it is an easy shot.

<b>PLEASE NOTE: there are no amenities what-so-ever at, in or around the Bisti Badlands</b> — no water, no picnic area, no restrooms, no Starbucks - nothing.

For part of the trail you will be hiking through a wash and scrambling over boulders and around fallen trees and bushes. This location is very remote with little discernible trail markers and it is easy to get lost or disoriented. I would strongly suggest hiking with others or at least downloading a GPS / hiking app to your smart phone and plot the GPS coordinates.";
