export const bodyTextArchangel =
  "When the conditions are right, these simple falls can provide one of your best photographic opportunities in Zion National Park. However, like most great things, this shot is not easy to come by. The Archangel Falls are located toward the end of a grueling 4 mile hike (Left Fork North Creek - Subway) through the Kolob Terrace in Zion National Park. The hike is not for the weak or the faint of heart, but at the end you are rewarded with 3 GREAT photographic opportunities (Archangel Fall, the Crack, and the iconic Subway).";

//Dead Horse Point
export const bodyTextDeadHorse =
  "It is hard to stand on the ledge of this location without wondering how all of this happened. The many layers of sandstone, buttes and vertical cliffs (carved by ice, water and wind) help to create a photographic masterpiece. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "This is a great location to spend a day or so hiking, exploring and experiencing this magnificent place – with the added bonus at sunrise and sunset for photographing a masterpiece of your own.";

//Factory Butte
export const bodyTextFactoryButte =
  "Sandwiched between Capital Reef, Canyonlands and Escalante sets the Factory Butte which is an oddly placed butte in the middle of a lifeless and barren badlands. The Factory Butte rises about 900ft from the desert floor with mesmerizing ripples and distinctive veins of rock. I had been to the area around Factory Butte several times before, but never could find an image I liked. Not until I was setting up camp after a long day of scouting. The above image was taken before sunrise from a campsite near the Factory Butte.";

//Bright Angel Point
export const bodyTextAngelPoint =
  "The North Rim is NOT your traditional tourist attraction. It has little to no cell service, one restaurant, no grocery store, one gas station, and there is very little to do. It is 80 miles from the closest town, and 6-8 hours from the nearest major airport. There are only two campsites and one lodge (built in the 1920’s, where you actually sleep in cabins) and you can forget Starbucks. The only place to get coffee in the morning is at the Saloon, where they still pour it from a pot. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "The North Rim is the opposite of the South Rim in almost every way. It has MUCH smaller crowds, and it is located in pine tree forest. It is cool in the summer and closed in the winter. It is over a 1,000 ft higher (almost 2,000 at Point Imperial) than the South Rim, and the mood is slow and relaxing.";

//White Pocket
export const bodyTextWhitePocket =
  "This small, intriguing rock formation (only 300 yds long x 800 yds wide) in the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument is filled with some of the most intriguing extra-terrestrial looking shapes you will find anywhere on the planet. From brain-rock to swirls, the red and yellow sandstone abstracts provide boundless photographic opportunities that are only limited by your imagination. But like most unique places, this one is very hard to get to and is only accessible if you come well prepared and committed.";

//Vista Point
export const bodyTextVistaPoint =
  "I was driving toward Mammoth Lakes when I happened to look over and see this breathtaking vista. I quickly pulled over and was able to capture this image directly from my van. In winter, on the road from Bishop to Mammoth Lakes, CA this wonderful scene presents itself and makes for an easy but stunning landscape opportunity. As wonderful as this location is, lighting is everything and the pink hues from late sun make this place magical.";

//The Overlook
export const bodyTextOverlook =
  "The area west of Hanksville, UT (seen by many as lifeless and barren badlands) provides for some of the most unusual topographical abstracts found anywhere in the American southwest. And from this location (sometimes called the Moonscape overlook) you have a grand view of the unlimited extraterrestrial like terrain that stretches as far as the eye can see.";

//Desert View
export const bodyTextDesertView =
  "For me, Desert View is my favorite location on the south rim of the canyon as it provides a spectacular view of the canyon in all her glory! From here, you can see the colors, the contrast, deep abstract gorges, endless layers of erosion, natural monuments and a great view of the reason it is here – the Colorado River. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "The reason this location is called Desert View is - it is at the eastern most point of the Grand Canyon and it includes an amazing view of the desert, buttes and mountains to the east of the canyon. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "There are several great locations to photograph the Desert View, but my favorite is Navajo Point – which is an easy half mile drive west of the Desert View visitors center. Also, Navajo Point doesn’t get as many visitors and has a great view of the Colorado river and the colorful west facing walls of the canyon.";

//Yousemite Falls Moonbow
export const bodyTextYosemite =
  "The moonbow can only be seen during April through June because the position of the moon and its angle to the falls are aligned to create the effect. The moonbow is most often photographed from the footbridge on the Lower Falls Trail where it crosses Yosemite Creek at the base of Lower Yosemite Falls. Although, there are locations in Cooks Meadow where the moonbow can be seen from a distance. A moonbow across the Upper Yosemite Falls can also be photographed from around Sentinel Bridge on the south side of Cooks Meadow.";

//Firefall
export const bodyTextFirefall =
  "There must be significant snowpack accumulated atop of El Capitan to provide the snow needed to create the waterfall. Then during the two week period the setting sun is aligned with the falls, it must be warm enough for the snow to melt and the falls to run and there cannot be any clouds that block the sun’s rays (which is often the case in the afternoon during this time of year). Finally the atmosphere itself must be clear enough to prevent any haze from blocking the sun’s light. ";

//Grand Falls
export const bodyTextGrandFalls =
  "Recently, it has become famous among the locals and photographers. Since it is accessible by driving on a dirt road for half hour, it is still not as crowded as some other locations in the area. It is a great place to spend some great quality time with family and friends of all fitness levels since no hiking is involved. For adventurous people, hiking to the base of the fall is also an option.  There is no official trail to hike to the base of the waterfall, however, there is a faint path that leads there. During spring months, flow can be pretty strong, making the trail wet, muddy and slippery.";

//Bisti Badlands
export const bodyTextBisti =
  "The Badlands offer some of the most unusual scenery in the American Southwest and National Geographic Travel listed it as one of their must visit adventure destinations for 2019. This wonderland is a special place for hikers, explorers and photographers (especially astrophotography) and is the closest thing to Mars I have ever seen. If you are a photographer, give yourself several days to explore and photograph the endless abstracts, hoodoos, desert spires, arches and amazing formations. ";

//Bonsai Rock
export const bodyTextBonsai =
  "The 72 mile drive around the lake can provide many epic views, but my favorite is a little cove on the north east side called Bonsai Rock. The location is named for a small, single Bonsai Tree that grows on top of a large protruding bolder just off the shoreline. This spot is one of the most beautiful places to shoot sunset in the Lake Tahoe area. The view, perspective, and size of the bolder changes based on your movement around the cove, the level of the lake and the time of the year of your visit.";

//Fallen Roof Ruin
export const bodyTextFallenRoof =
  "The site consists of four small well - preserved rooms with numerous small maize husks littering the floor of the rightmost room and painted handprints on the ceilings. Soot marks on the ceiling would indicate these rooms were used as both a living space and granary for storing food. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "These are protected sites, so please do not enter any of the rooms, only look through the windows; and do not touch or move any artifacts. Also, be cognizant of the roof slabs that are peeling away, which give the ruin its name. These heavy rock slabs can fall away at anytime, so do not touch the slabs and avoid walking directly underneath them. ";

//Monument Valley
export const bodyTextMonument =
  "The most famous monuments in the valley are the mittens (east and west), which you have seen many times in stunning landscape images, movies, and TV shows. The mittens themselves are worth the visit, but there is so much more in this sacred Navajo valley.\n" +
  "\n" +
  "The mittens (which stand about 1,000 feet from their base), when viewed from the south, appear to be two gigantic mittens with their thumbs facing inwards. This can make a great photograph for both sunrise and sunset.\n" +

  "This summary is specific to the shot above. I would suggest spending several days in the valley and explore the 5-10 other great photographic opportunities that exist here (both sunrise and sunset). ";

//Glacier Point
export const bodyTextGlacier =
  "If you have never been to Yosemite, it is hard to image a place this beautiful. Granite valleys cut from glaciers with breathtaking views and formations at every turn. Standing at Glacier Point, you are face to face with Half Dome and able to witness the majesty of the Yosemite in all her glory. From here you can see the Yosemite Village, Vernal & Nevada Falls, Olmsted Point and the granite mountains surrounding the valley.\n" +

//Twilight Near Mather Point
export const bodyTextTwilight =
  "Many articles and several books have been written to try to address the very best place(s) to visit and photograph the Canyon. Mather Point is likely the most visited and photographed location on the South Rim - and for good reason. Its proximity to the visitors center, natural viewing area and stunning view of the Bright Angel Canyon will draw a large crowd for both sunrise and sunset every day of the year. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "I am not a fan of big crowds, but love the view from around Mather Point. This shot was taken about 50 yards east of the Mather Point Overlook on the Rim Trail tucked away from the sea of tourists. From this location, you can capture the grandeur of the Bright Angel Canyon and include just a bit of the overlook to give it some dimension. There are many, many other equally impressive angles and view of this part of the canyon within 50-200 yards east of Mather Point. Just walk along the Rim Trail and pick your favorite composition.";

//Mesa Arch
export const bodyTextMesa =
  "What makes the Mesa Arch so special is the combination of several improbable events coming together at the same spot. First, you have an oddly placed arch teetering on the ledge of a 1,000ft. vertical drop. Then you have this magical red glow that only appears under the arch for the first hour or so after sunrise. And finally, you have this unworldly view of Buck Canyon with its moon-like floor and perfectly placed monuments. All of this topped with a spectacular view of the rugged White Rim and the La Sal Mountains in the distance.\n" +
  "\n" +
  "When you first see the red glow under the arch at sunrise you cannot help but to be astonished, and looking around you ask yourself, “How did this happen?”";

//The False Kiva
export const bodyTextFalseKiva =
  "Each time I visit here, I always ask myself, “How did this happen?” What are the chances of this perfectly shaped alcove, placed in the middle of nowhere, overlooking one of the most stunning vistas in the entire southwest? The Kiva is a ring of stacked rocks about 15 feet in diameter. The “False” part implies it is not a real Kiva (which was a ceremonial worship place for the Anasazi Indians).\n" +
  "\n" +
  "Unfortunately, someone vandalized the False Kiva in Summer 2018 with an open fire and graffiti on the red rock walls. Because of this, the National Parks Service has limited access to the alcove that includes the False Kiva. As of March 2019, you can hike to and enter the alcove, but the park service has erected a barrier around the False Kiva.  \n" +
  "\n" +
  "The False Kiva is a small and fragile location, but receives many visitors each year. I would ask that when you visit, please do your best to preserve all aspects of this location for future visitors and always try to leave it in better shape than when you found it.";

//Joshua Tree
export const bodyTextJoshua =
  "In the middle of absolute nowhere, in the most barren part of Death Valley you will find the wonder that is the Joshua Tree grove at Lee Flat. This vast forest of twisted, spiky trees looks like a scene straight out of a Dr. Seuss book. Miles and miles of pristine Joshua trees and surrounding mountain ranges provide unlimited photographic opportunities. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "If you like star gazing and astrophotography, Lee Flat is a perfect place as the Joshua Trees make for a great foreground and the dark skies illuminate the stars like few other places. And if you like to get off the beaten track and enjoy seeing unmarred natural landscapes, Lee Flat is a place you won't regret.";

//Owen River Sunrise
export const bodyTextOwen =
  "The shot above was taken at one of the many S curves along the Owen River near the little community of Big Pine, CA. After a strong snow storm hit the area, I wanted to find a location that captured the valley with the Sierra’s in the background. After driving around and hiking for a few hours, I stumbled upon this spot - which was literarily  in the middle of a cow pasture. The following morning, I was able to capture this shot just as the sun peeked through the clouds - right before I received an early morning visit from a mama cow and their calf. ";

//Narrows
export const bodyTextNarrows =
  "From a photographic standpoint, The Narrows are a cornucopia of incredible images. This hike is strenuous and demanding, but the dramatic patterns of the sandstone walls bathed by reflective light make for many unique photographic opportunities. A different view and photographic prospect greets you at each turn in the canyon.";

//Balanced Rock
export const bodyTextBalanced =
  "The total height of Balanced Rock is about 130ft., with the balancing rock 55ft. above the base. From a photographic standpoint, it is easy to make a great image. The shape and profile of the rock changes based on where you stand. The rock is made from red sandstone, which glows beautifully as the late sun touches it.";

//Upper Antelope Canyon
export const bodyTextUpper =
  "The canyons are constantly changing (from flash floods), so the time of year and even the time of day can make the same location look completely different. What makes photographing the canyons so distinctive is the camera often will see a totally different color spectrum than the human eye will. The unequal color temperatures (Kelvin, not Fahrenheit) inside the canyons render reds, purples, blues, and oranges that your eye simply does not see.\n" +
  "\n" +
  "There are two separate Antelope Canyons just outside Page, AZ: The Upper and the Lower Canyons are just up the road and across the highway from each other. It is a bit confusing, as the Upper Canyon is south side of the highway and the Lower Canyon is on the north side of the highway. The Upper Canyon is wider and shorter and is home to some unbelievable photographic opportunities. The Lower Canyon is narrower, longer and possesses some of the greatest abstracts anywhere.\n" +
  "\n" +
  "The sunbeams in the Upper Antelope Canyon helped to put Page, AZ, on the map, and are home to the Peter Lik masterpiece, “The Ghost.” This short slot canyon has produced some of the most famous images in the southwest. But fame sometimes comes at a price— and that price is the circus of tourists and visitors each day. ";
